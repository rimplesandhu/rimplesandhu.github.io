I am a Research Scientist in the Computational Science Center at the [National Laboratory of the Rockies (NLR)](https://www.nrel.gov), Golden, CO. My work sits at the intersection of **scientific machine learning**, **Bayesian inference**, and **applied mathematics**, with applications spanning renewable energy systems, wildlife ecology, and intelligent transportation.

## Research Interests

- **Probabilistic ML and AI for science** — developing data-efficient learning methods that quantify uncertainty and incorporate physical constraints
- **Energy-efficient computing** — reservoir computing, dimensionality reduction, and sparse learning as low-power alternatives to conventional deep learning
- **Decision-making under uncertainty** — Bayesian methods, control theory, active inference, and biological computing paradigms
- **Uncertainty quantification** — inverse problems, Kalman filtering, Bayesian model selection, and global sensitivity analysis

## Background

Before joining NLR as a postdoctoral researcher in 2020, I was a Visiting Research Scholar at the [National Research Council of Canada](https://nrc.canada.ca/en) (2018–2020) in Ottawa, collaborating with the Aerospace Research Center and Royal Military College of Canada. I completed my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca) in 2019, where my dissertation addressed model comparison and sparse learning of nonlinear physics-based models using Bayesian inference, supervised by Profs. Abhijit Sarkar, Dominique Poirel, and Chris Pettit.

I hold a Master of Applied Science in Civil Engineering from Carleton University (2012) and a Bachelor of Technology in Civil Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in) (2010).
