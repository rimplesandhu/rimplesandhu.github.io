## Overview

High-fidelity aeroelastic simulations (coupled CFD-CSD solvers) are computationally expensive, making direct global sensitivity analysis impractical. This project used polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) surrogate models to enable affordable Sobol variance-based sensitivity analysis of transonic flutter boundaries with respect to structural and aerodynamic parameters.

## Key Outputs

- Global sensitivity analysis of transonic flutter presented at the 31st ICAS Congress (2018)
- Fully coupled CFD-CSD flutter methodology published in *Journal of Aerospace Engineering* (2020)

## Skills and Methods

Surrogate modeling, Polynomial chaos expansion, Sobol sensitivity analysis, Coupled CFD-CSD, Finite element analysis, HPC, C++, Python
