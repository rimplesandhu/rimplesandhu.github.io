**Status:** Completed (2020–2023)
**Funding:** U.S. DOE Wind Energy Technologies Office

## Overview

Wind turbines pose collision risks to soaring raptors — particularly golden eagles — that exploit terrain-induced thermal updrafts for long-distance directional flights. This project developed probabilistic, physics-informed movement models to predict facility-scale raptor presence and turbine-level collision risk, enabling data-driven siting and operational decisions for wind energy developers.
