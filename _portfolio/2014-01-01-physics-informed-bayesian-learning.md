## Overview

Engineering models of complex physical systems are often over-parameterized relative to available measurement data, making reliable parameter inference and predictive model selection challenging. This project developed sparse Bayesian learning methods that simultaneously identify the most relevant model terms and rigorously quantify uncertainty in their values, enabling principled model complexity reduction.

## Key Contributions

- Developed nonlinear sparse Bayesian learning (NSBL) for physics-based models — reduced model complexity by 60% while maintaining predictive accuracy (*Journal of Computational Physics*, 2021)
- Extended Bayesian model selection using automatic relevance determination to nonlinear dynamical systems (*Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering*, 2017)
- Applied methods to aeroelastic limit cycle oscillations from wind-tunnel experiments (*Journal of Sound and Vibration*, 2022, 2023; *Journal of Computational Physics*, 2016)
- Validated Bayesian model selection for nonlinear aeroelastic systems against real wind-tunnel data (*Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering*, 2014)
