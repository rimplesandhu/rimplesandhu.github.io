## Overview

Conventional digital computing is reaching fundamental physical limits in energy efficiency. This project explores whether biological and biochemical systems can serve as practical, low-energy computing substrates for inference and control tasks relevant to energy systems. The hypothesis is that processes such as chemical reaction networks and cellular signaling inherently implement computations analogous to Bayesian inference and optimal control, potentially at orders-of-magnitude lower energy cost than silicon hardware.

## Research Directions

- Mapping control-theoretic frameworks (active inference, free-energy principle) onto biochemical reaction networks
- Designing optimal control strategies for oxygen concentration regulation in bioreactors
- Exploring reservoir computing using chemical kinetics as an energy-efficient ML paradigm
- Reviewing biological computing architectures (molecular computing, synthetic biology circuits) for energy efficiency
