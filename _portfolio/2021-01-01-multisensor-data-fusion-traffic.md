## Overview

Roadside infrastructure sensors — cameras, LiDAR, and radar — generate high-frequency, heterogeneous data streams that must be fused in real time to produce accurate, unified traffic state estimates. This project develops Kalman-filter-based data association algorithms for tracking vehicle and pedestrian trajectories from multi-sensor infrastructure deployments, with a focus on deployment on compute-constrained edge hardware.

## Contributions

- As subtask lead, spearheaded field data collection at instrumented intersections in Colorado Springs, CO
- Developed a multi-sensor object tracking dataset published in *IEEE Data Descriptions* (2025)
- Designed Kalman-filter-based sensor fusion pipelines for heterogeneous sensors on edge hardware
- Published ConOps for next-generation cooperative perception-based traffic control (ICTD, 2022)
- Contributed to media coverage: ["Giving Vehicles a Safe Green Light"](https://www.nrel.gov), NLR, 2022; ["Driving Innovation in Traffic Optimization"](https://carleton.ca), Carleton University, 2023
